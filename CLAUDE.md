# Rules

- NEVER make code changes without explicit user approval. Always explain what you want to change and wait for a "yes" before editing any file.
- Do NOT use the AskUserQuestion popup. Communicate only via inline text.
- NEVER commit and push unless told to.
- When the user says to test, they will: verify GitHub deploy completed, hard refresh, verify JS hash changed. Never ask about this.
- Research the codebase before guessing. Read the actual code.
- Defaults and fallbacks should come from ONE place only.
- The original project this was forked from is jaakkopasanen/ABX (not "JP-ABX" — JP refers to jaakkopasanen, not the repo owner's initials).
